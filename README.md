This is the code for the challenge "How to Make Data Amazing - Intro to Deep Learning #5" by Siraj Raval on Youtube


##Dependencies

* matplotlib 
* sklearn
* pandas
* numpy

The coding challenge for this video is to use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment) speed dating dataset to predict if someone gets a match or not. This dataset is labeled so 1 means they got a match and 0 means they didn't. Prediction is done by both SVM and a neural network build by myself using only numpy.
